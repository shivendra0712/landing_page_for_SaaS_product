# SaaS Product Landing Page (Pricing Section)

This repository contains the HTML for a pricing section of a Software as a Service (SaaS) product landing page. It showcases three different pricing plans with their features and calls to action. The page is styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Purpose

The purpose of this section is to clearly present the pricing options for the "TexSavy" SaaS product, highlighting the features of each plan and encouraging users to sign up or contact sales.

## Features

* **Clear Navigation:** Includes a basic navigation bar with the product name "TexSavy" and links for "Home," "Products," "Resource," and "Pricing," along with a "Sign Up" button (desktop view). A mobile menu icon is also present.
* **Introductory Content:** Features a brief introductory text explaining the pricing structure and options for monthly or annual billing.
* **Pricing Plan Cards:** Presents three distinct pricing plans: "Basic plan," "Business plan," and "Enterprise plan."
* **Key Plan Details:** Each plan card includes the plan name, price (with a strikethrough for the original price), a brief description, "Get started" and "Chat to sales" buttons, and a list of key features.
* **Feature Highlights:** Uses a checkmark icon (from Remix Icons) with a yellow background to visually emphasize the features included in each plan.
* **Responsive Design:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS classes to adapt the layout for different screen sizes, stacking the pricing cards on smaller screens and arranging them horizontally on larger (medium and up) screens.
